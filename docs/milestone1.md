# Introduction
Describe problem the software solves and why it's important to solve that problem

The package can automatically differentiate a function input into the program. By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to machine accuracy. It currently supports forward-mode differentiation.
The major application of automatic differentiation is gradient-based optimization, which is commonly used as the foundation of neural nets.

Calculates the derivative of a function to machine accuracy.
Avoid using the difference quotient, which is difficult to calculate to machine accuracy because, to estimate a limit approaching zero requires the computer to store and do computations with a very small number

# Background  
Automatic differentiation breaks down any function into its elementary functions using a graph structure and calculates the derivative while retaining the function by using dual numbers. This is accomplished by substituting (x + É› x-prime) for x in f(x).

As the steps of the graph structure become successively more complex, the derivatives of the preceding steps are used to compute the derivatives.

The chain rule is important for increasing the robustness of the automatic differentiation class, especially because it allows for the class to calculate the derivative of compositions (which are an important part of approximating non-linear functions).

# How to Use *AutoDiff*
How do you envision that a user will interact with your package?  What should they import?  How can they instantiate AD objects?

**Note: This section should be a mix of pseudo code and text.  It should not include any actual operations yet.**

Scalar function case:

```python
>>> import AutoDiff
>>> def function(x):
...	return x ** 2
>>> AutoDiff.getDiff(function, 2)
4
```

Vector function case:
```python
>>> import AutoDiff
>>> def function(x):
...	return x ** 2
>>> AutoDiff.getDiff(function, [1, 2])
np.array([2,4])
```
SINE, COSINE, EXPONENTIAL function case
```python
>>> import AutoDiff
>>> def function(x):
...	return Autodiff.sin(x)
>>> AutoDiff.getDiff(function, 0)
1
```

         LICENSE

</pre>

* What modules do you plan on including?  What is their basic functionality?
	Numpy: to do vector operations simultaneously
Math: to do sin/cos/exp functions

* Where will your test suite live?  Will you use `TravisCI`? `Coveralls`?
	The github page of our package will include TravisCI and Coveralls.
* How will you distribute your package (e.g. `PyPI`)?
Yes, we will distribute the package via PyPI.

# Implementation
Discuss how you plan on implementing the forward mode of automatic differentiation.
* What are the core data structures?
Dual object (from AutoDiff.dual)
* What classes will you implement?
AutoDiff.math
AutoDiff.dual
AutoDiff.array (will be defined if needed)
* What method and name attributes will your classes have?
AutoDiff.math
Methods:
Sin, cos, cot, arcsin, exp, log10, loge, ln etc
		These methods will be compatible with dual numbers, scalars, as well as vectors.
AutoDiff.dual
	Methods:
dunder methods (add,radd)
	Attributes:
Value
Derivative

* What external dependencies will you rely on?
numpy
math
* How will you deal with elementary functions like `sin` and `exp`?
We are going to import these functions from math and numpy packages and wrap it under our package to account for differentiation operations

Be sure to consider a variety of use cases.  For example, don't limit your design to scalar
functions of scalar values.  Make sure you can handle the situations of vector functions of vectors and scalar functions of vectors.  Don't forget that people will want to use your library in algorithms like Newton's method (among others).
